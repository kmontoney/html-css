<h3> About Me</h3>
<p> Hello and welcome to my about me page. Here is a little information about. I live in a family of six and I have three other siblings.
I'm the oldest out of them and then comes My sister Laine who's 13, my other sister Olivia or peanut as we call her who's 10, and my younger brother Trystan who's 9. 
My step-father owns his own carpet business and my mom helps. She also homeschools my other siblings. 
I was homeschooled from 4th up to high school. Me as a person I'm a little complicated. I'm usually the quiet and observant out of my friends, but sometimes Iâ€™ll let lose.
