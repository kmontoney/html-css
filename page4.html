<h3> Hobbies and Interest</h3>


<p> I'm a very advent hunter and fisher. 
I have fished since I was four and hunt since I was eight. 
I started hunting small game like dove and squirrels. 
When I was twelve I shot my first buck and the adrenaline rush was amazing I was shaking so much that my step-dad said I looked like a tree in a hurricane.
Usually when we kill a deer if we don't want all the meat we either give to family members or donate to homeless shelters

<p> Another hobby of mine is I Love playing airsoft. Me and my friends get together and shoot each other with plastic BBs. 
It’s awesome and we really get into it. I’m also a really advent gamer and always destroy my friends, especially when we play Halo.
